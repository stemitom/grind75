## Stack
Stack is a LIFO/FILO linear data structure which has insertion and deletion at one end of the data structure. The insertion and deletion operations are called push and pop respectively. 

The functions included with the stack are:
- `empty()`: Returns bool if a stack is empty or not
- `top()`: Return the top most element of a stack
- `push(element)`: Push an element to the end/top of a stack
- `pop()`: Pop/Remove the element at the end/top of a stack

It should be noted that all these operations are performed at constant time `0(1)`
